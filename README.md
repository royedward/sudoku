the sudoku game. Fifty games are include so hopefully
a user will not remember a given game.

Have fun playing.

I wrote the program using python 3.7. No external programs
were used.

The games have been designed to be easy to complete. However,
they can be adjusted to make them harder. Look at a json file.
Some numbers are a single digit and others are two digits. The
two digit numbers are "shifted to remove the zero" and then they
become the visible starting numbers.

To make the games harder, change a few numbers in each json file 
from two digits to one digit. Example: 80 becomes 8, 10 becomes 1.
Doing this will cause fewer starting numbers to be display, thus
making the games harder.
